# Apollo3 Uploader - SparkFun Variable Loader (SVL)

The ```svl``` bootloader is the default bootloader on Artemis module--based boards. This repo contains both the Python programs that are used to send code to a board and the source code for the program that receives code on an Artemis module.

The bootloader for the Artemis can be upgraded via Arduino using [these instructions](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/designing-with-the-sparkfun-artemis/all#troubleshooting). It can also be upgraded using the [Artemis Firmware Upload GUI](https://github.com/sparkfun/Artemis-Firmware-Upload-GUI).

Artemis SVL Versions:

* v5 - Speed and reliability increases
* v4 - Added peripheral deinitialization to deliver the Apollo3 closer to the initial reset state.
* v3 - Initial version

# Usage

* prerequisites
  * board has the SparkFun Variable Loader installed
    * source code is located in ```bootlaoder/src```
    * precompiled binaries and a makefile are located in ```bootloader/gcc```
      (the artemis module target is suitable for all current SparkFun products)
  * Python is installed on your computer
  * your program is compiled + linked to support the SVL (binary offset ```0x10000```)
* use the SVL loader script to upload to the board

  ```python svl.py [flags] port```
  
  * ```-b``` **baud rate**: 115200, 921600, or other desired common baud rate (57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600)
  * ```-f``` **filepath**: path to the binary image of your program to upload
  * ```port``` **serial port**: the serial port to connect over (*/dev/\** on \*nix or *COMX* on windows)
  * ```-v``` **verbose**: turn on verbose output
