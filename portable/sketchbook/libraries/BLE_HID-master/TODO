Somewhat sorted by priority:

* MacOSX testing (10.9)

* Windows testing

* IOS testing

* Size optimizations

* Output reports (e.g. keyboard LEDs)

* Low-energy: avoid sending spurious reports.

* Factor out common headers with mbed's USBHID. That means HID types and
  keyboard types.

* Multiple input/output reports
  For instance, when a device can act as mouse/keyboard combo, there will be
  two input reports characteristics with different IDs

* Boot protocol
  If BIOS and firmwares start supporting BLE and GATT one day...
